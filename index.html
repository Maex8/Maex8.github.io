    <h1>Bodybuilder 1. title</h1>
    <p>Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to build, control, and develop one's muscles via hypertrophy.
    An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes
     over functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting, which focuses solely on gaining physical strength.</p>

    <p>Bodybuilding requires much time and effort to reach the desired results. A bodybuilder may be able to gain</p> 
    
    <ul>
        <li>8–20 pounds (4–9 kg) of muscle per year as a complete Novice</li>
        <li>5–15 pounds (2–7 kg) per year after the first two years</li>
        <li>3–10 pounds (1–5 kg) per year after five years of training </li>
    </ul>
